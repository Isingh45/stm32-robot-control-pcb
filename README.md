CMPE 492 / CMPE 493 (2025–2026)


# Overview

MecaArm is a custom embedded robotics platform developed as a senior design capstone project. The project replaces vendor control electronics with a custom STM32-based control board, providing direct access to embedded hardware, motor control, communication interfaces, and power management.

The platform combines hardware design, embedded firmware development, Bluetooth communication, mobile-app integration, and system-level validation into a single robotics platform.

# Repository Purpose

This repository preserves the hardware, firmware, documentation, and validation artifacts associated with the MecaArm Senior Design project.

---

# Key Features

## Custom 4-Layer PCB

Developed and validated a custom 4-layer PCB centered around the STM32F429VET6 microcontroller.

Features include:

* Multi-rail power architecture
* Motor driver integration
* Servo interfaces
* Bluetooth communication interface
* Expansion support for future sensor integration
* Debug and programming interfaces

---

## Embedded Control System

The STM32 firmware provides:

* PWM motor control
* Servo control
* UART communication
* Bluetooth command processing
* Real-time actuator control

An ESP32 module serves as a Bluetooth-to-UART bridge between the mobile application and the STM32 controller.

---

## Mobile Application Control

A custom MIT App Inventor application enables wireless control of:

* Mecanum-wheel locomotion
* Robotic arm movement
* System operation through Bluetooth communication

---

## Multi-Rail Power Architecture

The platform utilizes a dedicated power distribution architecture:

* 7.4V battery rail
* Independent 5V motor rail
* Independent 5V auxiliary rail
* Dedicated 3.3V logic rail

This separation helps isolate high-current motor loads from sensitive logic circuitry and communication interfaces.

# Demonstrated Functionality

The completed system successfully demonstrated:

* Bluetooth communication
* Mobile application control
* ESP32-to-STM32 communication
* Mecanum-wheel movement
* Multi-servo robotic arm control
* Custom PCB operation
* Stable multi-rail power delivery
* End-to-end hardware and firmware integration

# Notes

The custom PCB includes provisions for future expansion, including sensor and peripheral interfaces. While these interfaces were incorporated into the hardware design, the final demonstrated system focused on locomotion, robotic arm control, Bluetooth communication, embedded control, and full-system integration.

Interfaces for future development were included in the hardware architecture; however, features such as camera integration, IMU-based control, ultrasonic sensing, and autonomous navigation were not fully implemented in the final project demonstration.
