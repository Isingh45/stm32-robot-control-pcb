# MecaArm Robotic Platform

## Overview

MecaArm is an STM32-based mobile robotic platform developed as the Senior Design Capstone project for **CMPE 492 / CMPE 493** at **California State University, East Bay**.

The platform integrates omnidirectional Mecanum-wheel locomotion, a multi-servo robotic arm, a custom four-layer PCB, embedded firmware, Bluetooth communication, and a mobile application into a complete robotics system.

The project demonstrates end-to-end embedded systems engineering by combining custom hardware design, firmware development, wireless communication, power electronics, and system-level validation.

## Features

* **Custom Four-Layer PCB:** Designed a custom four-layer PCB centered around the STM32F429VET6 microcontroller with dedicated power distribution, motor drivers, communication interfaces, and debugging support.

* **Omnidirectional Mecanum Drive:** Controls four independently driven Mecanum wheels using PWM motor control and dual TB6612FNG motor drivers for omnidirectional robot movement.

* **Robotic Arm Control:** Controls a multi-servo robotic arm using STM32 hardware timers and PWM signals for coordinated actuator movement.

* **Bluetooth Wireless Communication:** Uses an ESP32 as a Bluetooth-to-UART bridge, allowing a custom MIT App Inventor mobile application to wirelessly control the robot.

* **Embedded Firmware:** Developed STM32 firmware using STM32 HAL to manage motor control, servo control, UART communication, and command processing.

* **Multi-Rail Power Architecture:** Designed dedicated power rails for motors, auxiliary peripherals, and logic circuitry to improve electrical stability and isolate high-current motor loads from sensitive electronics.

* **System Integration and Validation:** Successfully demonstrated integrated hardware, firmware, Bluetooth communication, mobile application control, robotic locomotion, and robotic arm operation.
